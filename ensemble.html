  <h2 class="text-left mt-2">About Ensemble</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Ensemble is a concept mobile application that connects local musicians based on the userâ€™s specifications. It provides a platform that allows the user to easily connect and collaborate with other musicians in their area. I created this design solution as a way to solve the problem of musicians such as myself, having difficulty meeting others to collaborate with.</p>
</div>

<!-- The Problem -->

<div class="container-fluid blue text-center">
  <div class="container pb-4">
    <h3 style="font-size: 16px;" class="section-title text-center pt-5"><strong>The Problem</strong></h3>
    <p><strong>Many musicians face difficulty when it comes to meeting others to collaborate with. Whether you're a social butterfly or an introvert, finding the right person or people to jam with is challenging.</strong></p>

  <h2 class="text-left mt-2">Understanding the user</h2>
  <hr>
  	<p>
        Before beginning the design process, it was important for me to create a moodboard and personas that represented the target audience for Ensemble. After chatting with musicians around my university, I was able to gain an idea of what types of users would be using the app. The users of the app would be musicians who are struggling to meet people to collaborate with. They enjoy connecting with others especially through sharing a common interest of music. The moodboard demonstrated the atmosphere and feel that I wanted the app to express. Both these deliverables allowed me to keep the target audience in mind as I began the design process.

      <h2 class="text-left mt-2">Interviewing users to help guide the design process</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>I had a few  initial ideas about how to design Ensemble, but I needed to validate my assumptions to ensure I was on the right track. I wanted to get feedback to gain an understanding of what potential users would be looking for in an app like Ensemble. For example, I wanted to know what criteria musicians would want to use to determine their matches. Thus, I interviewed musicians around my university and asked them the following questions:</p>        </p>
      <ol class="pb-5">
        <li>Are you a casual jammer or part of a band?</li>
        <li>Are you interested in meeting new people to make music with? Whether it be casual jamming or finding a band to join?</li>
        <li>Do you find it challenging to meet other musicians to collaborate with?</li>
        <li>If so, what makes it difficult for you to meet others?</li>
        <li>What would you look for in a musician of you wanted to collaborate with someone? (Music taste, instruments, etc.)</li>
      </ol>

    <h2 class="text-left mt-2">Analyzing the research</h2>
    <hr>
    <ol>
      <li>Most students were casual jammers, however there were a couple who were part of a band.</li>
      <li>Most musicians were interested in finding people to collaborate with but found it difficult due to these reasons:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Not having other musically inclined friends</li>
        <li>Not having the courage to reach out to others</li>
        <li>Feeling that the people who they do reach out to already have their own groups</li>
        <li>Other muscians that are around aren't into the same music</li>
        <li>It takes too much effort to go out and try to find people especially in university when the amount of students is overwhelming</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Users want to filter their search for other musicians by:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Genre</li>
        <li>Instruments</li>
        <li>Location</li>

    <hr>
    <p>In order to solve painpoints such as having difficulty meeting people with a certain musical style or people who play a certain instrument, I came up with the following app features that would make the process of meeting other musicians as effective as possible.</p>
    <ol class="pb-5">
      <li>Personal profile that lets the user post videos and audio of their work as well as specify which instruments they play.</li>
      <li>Ability to select location, preferred instruments and genres when discovering local musicians.</li>
      <li>Ability to view profiles & send friend requests to the potential musicans the app matches users with.</li>
      <li>Messaging feature that allows users to communicate and set up meeting times.</li>

      <p>To ensure that my designs were functional for users, I tested the low-fidelity wireframes. Users were able to navigate through the app with little trouble and follow through to finding their matches, however they brought to light several issues with the discovery section of the app. </p>
      <ol class="pb-5">
        <li>The discovery section needs more filters such as age and gender. Also, instead of location have a distance filter.</li>
        <li>There should also be an option to select the type of musician the user is looking for (casual jammer, band member, band).</li>
        <li>For the "Preferred Genres" filter, there should be an option to for users who don't have a preference for genres.</li>

  <p>Taking into consideration the recommendations of the users, I created high-fidelity wireframes that would tackle their issues with the discovery component of the app. I also created a better on boarding flow which helps identify what type of musician the user is from the get-go.</p>

They can discover local musicians by pressing the magnifying glass icon which directs them to the discover page. Here, users can enter their location, the type of musicians they are looking for and their preferred genres. This will narrow down their potential matches. </p>

    <h5>Finding Matches</h5>
    <p>Once the user finishes entering their preferences, a list of musicians within their locality matching their specifications will be displayed.
